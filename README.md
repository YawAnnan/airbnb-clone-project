## Technology Stack

A high-level overview of the core technologies leveraged in this project:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to create a robust foundation for building RESTful APIs and core backend logic.
- **Django REST Framework**: Extends Django with powerful tools and abstractions for building and managing RESTful API endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL**: A reliable, production-grade relational database system used to store and manage structured data with strong integrity and performance.
- **GraphQL**: Provides flexible, efficient, and client-driven data querying capabilities, allowing consumers to request exactly what they need.
- **Celery**: A distributed task queue used to process asynchronous jobs such as sending notifications or processing payments, outside the main request lifecycle.
- **Redis**: Serves dual roles as a high-performance in-memory cache and as a message broker for Celery tasks, improving response times and background processing.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool that ensures a consistent and reproducible development and deployment environment across all stages of the project lifecycle.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated workflows that build, test, and deploy code changes, ensuring stability and speed in delivery.

### Relationships

- A **User** (as host) **can own many** **Properties**.
- A **User** (as guest) **can create many** **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** **belongs to one** **Property** and one **User**.
- Each **Booking** typically has one **Payment** associated.
- A **User** **can write many** **Reviews**, each linked to a **Property** and **Booking**.



## Feature Breakdown

Below are the core features of the project, each supporting a critical aspect of the user experience and system functionality.

### User Management  
Enable users, both guests and hosts, to register, log in (including third-party options like Google or social media), and manage profiles with photos and bios. This builds trust and makes the platform more secure and personal.  

### Property Management  
Hosts can create and manage listings by adding descriptions, high-quality photos, availability calendars, pricing, and amenities. This functionality is essential for showcasing rentals effectively.  


### Search & Booking System  
Guests can search for rentals using filters like location, price, and availability, and then request or instantly book a property. This ensures a seamless reservation experience from discovery to booking.  

### Secure Payments  
Integrate secure payment gateways such as PayPal, Stripe, credit/debit cards in order for guests to make payments safely and hosts receive payouts seamlessly. This functionality instills user confidence and supports smooth transactions.  


### Reviews & Ratings  
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties and hosts after their stays. This system fosters transparency, builds trust, and helps maintain quality in the marketplace.  

### Messaging System  
Built-in communication enables guests and hosts to chat before, during, and after stays, facilitating questions, clarifications, and rapport building. It enhances user experience and reduces friction.  


## API Security

Securing backend APIs is essential to protect user data, financial transactions, and maintain trust. Below are the key security measures implemented in this project and why they matter:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**  
   - **Authentication** ensures that only verified users or services can access API endpoints.  
   - **Authorization** determines what those authenticated entities are allowed to do (e.g., only booking owners can cancel bookings).  
   This prevents unauthorized access and enforces the principle of least privilege. Deviations here are among the top API security risks outlined by OWASP and DRF security best practices. 

2. **Rate Limiting (Throttling)**  
   Controls the frequency and volume of requests to the API to prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, and accidental overloads.  
   This is particularly critical for unauthenticated or high-traffic endpoints. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

3. **Transport Security (HTTPS)**  
   Encrypts data in transit between clients and the server, safeguarding sensitive information like credentials and payment details from interception. 

4. **Input Validation & Data Exposure Control**  
   Sanitizes and validates incoming data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection) and ensures only necessary information is exposed in responses.  
   This addresses common API vulnerabilities like excessive data exposure. 

5. **Logging, Monitoring & Alerting**  
   Captures API request patterns, errors, and suspicious activity to provide visibility, aid in incident detection, and support audits.  
   Effective logging helps detect malicious behavior early and supports post-event analysis.

###  Why These Measures Matter for the Project

- **Protecting User & Payment Data**: APIs handle registration, bookings, payments, and personal information, making authentication, encryption, and validation non-negotiable.
- **Resilience Against Abuse**: Rate limiting guards against denial-of-service attempts and brute-force registration or login attacks.
- **Regulatory Compliance & Trust**: Secure APIs help meet standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS and nurture user confidence in the platform.
- **Operational Stability & Security Visibility**: Monitoring, logging, and alerting systems equip developers with the tools to proactively detect misuse or attacks.
