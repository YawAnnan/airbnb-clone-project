# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview
This is a scalable and production-ready **AirBnB clone** built to demonstrate full-stack development with a modern, asynchronous architecture. It focuses on delivering core functionality, like property listings, bookings, and user interactions, while showcasing background processing, flexible APIs, and development agility.

#### Project Goals
- Rebuild key Airbnb-like features: user registration, property listings, search and booking flows, and notifications.
- Build a clean, maintainable codebase thatâ€™s easy to test, extend, and deploy.
- Use automation to streamline development and promote a DevOps-oriented workflow.

#### Technology Stack
- **Django**
- **Django REST Framework** 
- **PostgreSQL**
- **GraphQL** 
- **Celery**
- **Redis** 
- **Docker**
- **CI/CD Pipelines**

## Technology Stack

A high-level overview of the core technologies leveraged in this project:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to create a robust foundation for building RESTful APIs and core backend logic.
- **Django REST Framework**: Extends Django with powerful tools and abstractions for building and managing RESTful API endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL**: A reliable, production-grade relational database system used to store and manage structured data with strong integrity and performance.
- **GraphQL**: Provides flexible, efficient, and client-driven data querying capabilities, allowing consumers to request exactly what they need.
- **Celery**: A distributed task queue used to process asynchronous jobs such as sending notifications or processing payments, outside the main request lifecycle.
- **Redis**: Serves dual roles as a high-performance in-memory cache and as a message broker for Celery tasks, improving response times and background processing.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool that ensures a consistent and reproducible development and deployment environment across all stages of the project lifecycle.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated workflows that build, test, and deploy code changes, ensuring stability and speed in delivery.
