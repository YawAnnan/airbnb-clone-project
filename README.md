# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview
This is a scalable and production-ready **AirBnB clone** built to demonstrate full-stack development with a modern, asynchronous architecture. It focuses on delivering core functionality—like property listings, bookings, and user interactions—while showcasing background processing, flexible APIs, and development agility.

### Project Goals
- Rebuild key Airbnb-like features: user registration, property listings, search and booking flows, and notifications.
- Build a clean, maintainable codebase that’s easy to test, extend, and deploy.
- Use automation to streamline development and promote a DevOps-oriented workflow.

## Technology Stack
- **Django** – high-level Python framework for building the core RESTful API.  
- **Django REST Framework** – augment Django with tools for building RESTful endpoints.  
- **PostgreSQL** – robust relational database for data persistence.  
- **GraphQL** – for flexible, client-driven data querying.  
- **Celery** – handles background tasks like sending emails or processing bookings.  
- **Redis** – powers caching, session storage, and Celery’s message queues.  
- **Docker** – enables containerized development environments for consistency across machines.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – automate testing and deployments using tools like GitHub Actions or CircleCI.
